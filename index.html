        <h2>Why do we love games? Seems like a silly question but we'll list some of our resons</h2>

            <li>Computer games entertain us</li>
            <li>When we sit alone in the dark, we can always log into our favorite game and talk to other humans or game
                characters
            </li>
            <li>Games don't care how you feel or how you look, they are always there for you.</li>
            <li>Games can tell deep and personal stories, or let you jump into instant action to forget about the stress
                of the day.
            </li>
            <li>Other gamers will usually not care about how many friends you have, if you are getting picked on or your
                race; they'll play with you any how
            </li>

    <div class="box-area" id="Organiseres">
        <h2>Dette må organiseres til å se pent ut!</h2><br>
        As you can tell games are amazing and we genuinely believe that they improve the life quality of countless
        people, everyone should share in the joy! <br>
        Since other gamers can't see you they judge you purely based on your skills, ignoring everything else. You
        teammates don't care if you sit in a wheelchair or 2000$ gaming chair. <br>
        But all is not well with games today, while the gaming is for all the games are often not made with
        accessibility in mind. <br>
        There have been great strives towards accessibility on the web, guidelines such as WCAG and preasure towards
        accessible design has made the web a more inclusive and better place for all. <br>
        But there are no "wcag" for games, it is up to the game company if they want to make the game inclusive, and far
        too often accessibility is being neglected. <br>
        We want games to be for everyone and made this website to use for all that make games, use games and review
        games. We have compiled guidelines on how to make games more accessible <br>
        It is our hope that with this gamemakers can easily see what to do to make their games more accessible, and game
        reviewers and buyers can start caring about accesibility when deciding what games to buy<br>
        <h2>Why should I care?</h2>
        When we design with accessibility and universal design in mind we make our available to a wider audience. <br>
        Even if we fail to meet all the GCAG requirements and only skim the universal design guidelines meeting at least some of them will make the product better
        <p>We believe that if we all try our best with the resources we have at hand to make our products as accessible but still awesome as possible we can reach a wider audience; <br>
        a wider audience can use our produects and competitors become incentivize to follow in our accessible footsteps, if only to reach a wide of an audience as we are. <br>

            The GCAG guidelines make accessibility in games easier, commercially  sound and give a competitive edge to making the world a better and more incluse place for all.
        </p>
        Consumers and reviewers can also use GCAG, buyers can choose to spend their money one inclusive games and game reviewers can give games accessibility scores.<br> The more people care the bigger the demand for accessible products even from those that don't necessarily need them.

        <br><br>See the embedded YouTube-video for real life examples on how to make a game more accessible and why you should care.

        <h2>Universal design</h2>
        This site is dedicated to accessibility we also wish to discuss universal design, following the accessibility
        guidelines here will help you achieve greater universal design, but does not encompass all of universal design.
        <br> Even though we probably never will reach complete universal design, we should as game designer strive
        towards as universal design as possible; and as consumer demand universal design in the products we buy.<br>
        A good way to measure universal design is by the 7 universal design principles, these can be taken into
        consideration when making a game, used to measure existing games and used to improve existing games. <br>
        The guidelines can be read at <a href="http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/The-7-Principles/">universaldesign.ie</a>
