        <li>Computer games entertain us</li>
        <li>When we sit alone in the dark, we can always log into our favorite game and talk to other humans or game characters</li>
        <li>Games don't care how you feel or how you look, they are always there for you.</li>
        <li>Games can tell deep and personal stories, or let you jump into instant action to forget about the stress of the day.</li>
        <li>Other gamers will usually not care about how many friends you have, if you are getting picked on or your race; they'll play with you any how</li>

    <h2>Dette må organiseres til å se pent ut!</h2><br>
    As you can tell games are amazing and we genuinely believe that they improve the life quality of countless people, everyone should share in the joy! <br>
    Since other gamers can't see you they judge you purely based on your skills, ignoring everything else. You teammates don't care if you sit in a wheelchair or 2000$ gaming chair. <br>
    But all is not well with games today, while the gaming is for all the games are often not made with  accessibility in mind. <br>
    There have been great strives towards accessibility on the web, guidelines such as WCAG and preasure towards accessible design has made the web a more inclusive and better place for all. <br>
    But there are no "wcag" for games, it is up to the game company if they want to make the game inclusive, and far too often accessibility is being neglected. <br>
    We want games to be for everyone and made this website to use for all that make games, use games and review games. We have compiled guidelines on how to make games more accessible <br>
    It is our hope that with this gamemakers can easily see what to do to make their games more accessible, and game reviewers and buyers can start caring about accesibility when deciding what games to buy<br>
